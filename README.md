 <summary><h3>üñ•Ô∏è My Journey</h3></summary>
   I was introduced to SQL and advanced Excel when I was working as a quality engineer for IBM where I realized the power a couple lines of code can do to solve business problems. As a naturally curious person always looking to work smarter, I learned Python for data analysis. 
   <br>
   <br>
   I was lucky! Because I applied what I had learned in Excel and Python to understand the data collected in my research experiments while I did my Masters in Food Science at the University of British Columbia.
   <br>
   <br>
   After graduation, I worked in quality and food safety where I used Excel to ensure sanitary and safe food production. This is when I decided to pursue a career in data although I still remain passionate about the food industry.
   <br>
   <br>
   Cheers!
