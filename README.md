 <summary><h3>🖥️ My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I was introduced to SQL when I was working as a quality engineer for IBM where I realized the power a couple lines of code to solve business problems. As a naturally curious person this sparked an interest to learn Python to understand the data collected in my chemistry experiments while I did my masters research in food science at UBC.
   <br>
   <br>
   After graduating and working in quality and food safety I decided that a career where I could use data and some code to make better decisions was what I wanted. But I remain passionate about the food industry.
   <br>
   <br>
   That brings me to today. I still am very curious and driven to learn the ins and outs to become a successful data scientist.
